## üìë My Mother at Sixty-Six Summary

One last Friday morning, the poetess was driving from her parents‚Äô home to the Cochin airport. Her mother was sitting beside her in the car. She suddenly had a look at her mother. She found that her mother was dozing with her open mouth. Her face was as pale as that of a corpse. The poet painfully realized that her mother is not going to live long. This painful thought haunted her. But soon she tried to put it off by looking out of the car window. She saw the young trees running past them. She looked at the merry children coming out of their homes. As she saw life and vitality in the outside world, the painful thought passed away from her mind.


After reaching the airport, she went through the security check. Her mother was standing outside a few yards away. After the security check, she looked at her mother again. Her face was pale white like a late winter‚Äôs moon. She felt the old familiar ache of childhood in her heart which is usually felt by a child due to the fear of separation from his/ her mother. But she contained herself and kept on smiling in order to conceal her emotions. She spoke no word to her mother. All that she said was, ‚ÄúSee you soon, Amma‚Äù and bade good bye to her mother with a hope to see her again.

## üîç My Mother at Sixty-Six Question and Answer

### üü¢ Think it out

**Q1. What is the kind of pain and ache that the poet feels?**

A. She sees that her mother is old and pale. She was looking ashen like a corpse. She starts feeling the pain of separation. This pain is similar to her feelings of childhood when her mother moved away from her.

**Q2. Why are the young trees described as ‚Äòsprinting‚Äô?**

A. The young trees have been personified. When looked at from the poet‚Äôs moving car, they seem to be running past. The poet found it to be strikingly opposite to her mother who looked as still as a dead body.

**Q3. Why has the poet brought in the image of the merry children ‚Äòspilling out of their homes‚Äô?** 

A. The poet draws a comparison between what is travelling with her and what she can see outside. It‚Äôs a comparison between life and death. Her mother is sleeping, with mouth open, like a dead body. She represents melancholy and inactivity, whereas on the outside she can see children who are full of life, energy and enthusiasm.

**Q4. Why has the mother been compared to the ‚Äòlate winter‚Äôs moon‚Äô?**

A. Just as the late winter‚Äôs moon is dull and lacks luster, so is her mother at the end stage of her life. Also, as the late winter moon gets overshadowed by the fog and mist in the sky similarly her mother can get overshadowed by death at any time. Both of them are nearing an end- one of season and the other of life.

**Q5. What do the parting words of the poet and her smile signify?**

A. The parting words of the poet show her positive attitude. The poet wants to give comfort and assurance to her mother that she will return soon to meet her again.
