In the poem A Roadside Stand, Frost presents the lives of poor deprived people with pitiless clarity and with the deepest sympathy and humanity."/ >}}


## 📑 A Roadside Stand Summary

There is a roadside stand at the edge of the road. Those who established it certainly did so to earn money. They expected their prospective customers to stop there and buy things. But the rich and the refined people drive past without stopping there. The roadside stand offers ordinary things for sale like wild berries and golden gourds.

The people who run this stand hope for city-money so that they may also prosper. There is a news that their land will be bought by the government. The so called good doers and greedy people exploit them. Some people who pretend to be generous are even worse than flesh-eating wild animals. These greedy people want to mint money by befooling the innocent rural people.

The people who run this roadside stand hope that some car will stop there. They keep their windows open so that some customer may oblige them. But some come only to back or turn around the car or to ask the way where it is bound.

The poet will feel greatly relieved if all their pains and troubles are removed at one stroke. Death is far better than their miserable living.

  But in fact those who promise to do something good for villagers are themselves greedy people. They are pretending to benefit these villagers but actually they are making a profit for themselves. Many such people come to village. They affect thinking of villagers which forces villagers to shift to cities. Villagers start thinking that shifting to city will reduce their current problems. In the city the life is different. Many times they need to work in nights so they need to sleep during the day. Their life style goes under a total change. It is not the same old style.

Yet another car stopped to ask if the shopkeeper was selling fuel. The shopkeeper angrily though if they could not see what was being sold.

## 🔍 A Roadside Stand Question and Answer

### 🟢 Think it out

**Q1. The city folk who drove through the countryside hardly paid any heed to the roadside stand or to the people who ran it. If at all they did, it was to complain. Which lines bring this out? What was their complaint about?**

A. The lines that indicate this are as follows: 

- The polished traffic passed with a mind ahead, 
- Or if ever aside a moment, then out of sorts 
- At having the landscape marred with the artless paint

They complained about the shabby paint on the walls of these sheds that has spoiled the beauty of the landscape.

**Q2. What was the plea of the folk who had put up the roadside stand?** 

A. They pled for flow of cash from the pockets of the city dwellers into their hands so that they can also make good use of the money. They want to feel the money on their hands.

**Q3. The government and other social service agencies appear to help the poor rural people, but actually do them no good. Pick out the words and phrases that the poet uses to show their double standards.**

A. The poet criticizes the double standards of the government and other social service agencies who promise to improve the standard of living of the poor farmers and show them the rosy side of life. Yet, when the time comes to deliver their promise, they either forget them or fulfill them keeping in view their own benefits.  The poet calls them “greedy good-doers” and “beneficent beasts of prey”, who “swarm over their lives”. The poet says that these greedy people make calculated and well thought-out shrewd moves, to which the innocent, unaware farmers fall prey. These humble and simple farmers are robbed of their peace of mind by these clever people. The poet says,  
“…..enforcing benefits  
That are calculated to soothe them out of their wits,  
And by teaching them how to sleep they sleep all day,  
Destroy their sleeping at night the ancient way.”

**Q4. What is the ‘childish longing’ that the poet refers to? Why is it ‘vain’?**

A. The desire of the shed owner that some cars will stop by to buy something or at least to enquire the prices of the farmer’s produce is the childish longing. It is vain or futile because no car stops by. They wait with windows open and pray all day but the effort is wasted.


**Q5. Which lines tell us about the insufferable pain that the poet feels at the thought of the plight of the rural poor?**

A. Being filled with empathy, the poet is not able to bear the plight of the innocent and unassuming rural people. The lines which tell us about the insufferable pain is:  
“Sometimes I feel myself I can hardly bear  
The thought of so much childish longing in vain,  
The sadness that lurks near the open window there,   
That waits all day in almost open prayer”
