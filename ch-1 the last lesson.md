## üìë The Last Lesson Summary

The story is narrated by a French boy, Franz. He is lazy but sensitive and likes to play. He dislikes studying French and hates his teacher M. Hamel.

After overpowering their districts of Alsace and Lorraine in France, Berlin has ordered that German language instead of French be taught in the schools there.

It is the last day of their French teacher M. Hamel, who has been there for forty years. He is full of grief, nostalgia and patriotism. As a mark of respect to his hard work, the village men also attend his ‚Äòlast lesson‚Äô. They are sad as they did not learn their mother tongue, French in their childhood.

Franz is shocked to know that it‚Äôs his last lesson, as he does not know French. Now, suddenly, he gets interested in learning it and understands everything taught on that day!

He develops an instant liking for the teacher, M. Hamel and respects him for his sincerity and hard work.

He feels sad at departing from him and is ashamed for not being able to recite the lesson of participles.

M. Hamel tells them that they all are at fault for not being eager enough to learn, putting it off to the next day. He blames himself for not teaching them sincerely.

His patriotism is reflected in his praise for the French language as being the most beautiful and most logical language in the world. He tells the class to guard their language as being close to one‚Äôs language is the key to escape from the prison of slavery. It will help them in getting free from the Germans.

They realize the importance of learning their mother tongue and that they have been defeated by the Germans because of their illiteracy.

Franz feels that it is not possible to take away one‚Äôs language from a person as it is natural to each being, may it be the ‚Äúcoo‚Äù to the pigeons or ‚ÄúFrench‚Äù to the Frenchmen.

### üî¥ Understanding the text

**Q1. The people in this story suddenly realise how precious their language is to them. What shows you this? Why does this happen?**

A. When the village men realize that their mother tongue, French will no longer be taught to them, they realize its importance. Suddenly, they develop an inclination towards learning.

They attend the last lesson of French, bring their old, torn primers to learn the language which shows their eagerness. They regret putting off learning French to the next day. Now, finally, the last lesson has arrived, and they cannot read their own language. They are ashamed of themselves and realize that the Germans have overpowered them due to their lack of knowing their own language.

**Q2. Franz thinks, ‚ÄúWill they make them sing in German, even the pigeons?‚Äù What could this mean?**

A. Franz is disheartened when he comes to know that he can no longer learn his language ‚Äì French. Their district has been captured by Germany and now German will be taught to them. Franz feels that mother tongue comes to a person naturally, he is born with it and no one can snatch it away.

Just like the pigeons make the ‚Äòcoo‚Äô sound, irrespective of the country from which they are, similarly, human beings also communicate in their mother tongue. As the Germans are trying to impose their language on the French, so similarly, Franz feels that they will teach the pigeons also to ‚Äòcoo‚Äô in German language. He has given this example to highlight his point that language is a natural mode of communication and it cannot be imposed.

### üîµ Talking about the text

**Q1. ‚ÄúWhen a people are enslaved, as long as they hold fast to their language it is as if they had the key to their prison.‚Äù Can you think of examples in history where a conquered people had their language taken away from them or had a language imposed on them?**

A. It had happened in India. The Mughals had introduced Urdu in India. Most of the official work was being done in Urdu language. Till about 50 years ago, many native elderly people did not how to read and write Punjabi language. But they were proficient in Urdu.
The British had introduced English language in India. It is slowly overtaking other languages of India. There are many examples across the world when a conqueror had imposed their language on native people. Germans, USA, Russia and England had done this.

**Q2. What happens to a linguistic minority in a state? How do you think they can keep their language alive? For example: Punjabis in Bangalore, Tamilians in Mumbai, Kannadigas in Delhi, Gujaratis in Kolkata?**

A. They keep their language intact by talking native language. They continue to see movies of subscribe to newspaper and journals of their own rituals are carried out through a priest of their own among themselves in their their own language. They language. Several religious native place. The marriage would take place in their native area and they regularly visit their native place. These are some of the means through which they keep their language alive.

**Q3. Is it possible to carry pride in one‚Äôs language too far? Do you know what ‚Äòlinguistic chauvinism‚Äô means?**

A. One should take pride in one's own language. In fact it comes so naturally to everybody. 

'Linguistic chauvinism' means an excessive love towards one's language and hatred to other language. One would try to propagate one language over any other language. 

Let us understand that the world around us is changing at a very fast pace. People have moved to different places. This is true with respect to a town, city, state, country and the whole world. Mixing of people has brought about a change in the language. Many times the need of a common language becomes essential.

Under these circumstances changes in language is naturally happening almost everywhere in the world.

**2. Write a paragraph of about 100 words arguing for or against having to study three languages at school.**

**For:**

Language connects people. Most of the people feel emotionally closer and friendlier if they talk in their native language. Knowing one more language gives access to one more set of literature. It enhances our thought process. It builds our vocabulary It helps ourselves in connecting with more people.

Gone are the days when people used to stay at their native place. People move out. It could be for travel, for study, for job or for business. Knowledge of an additional language comes very handy in such situations.

In fact knowledge of an additional language during school days, orients one to acquire more languages. Thereby giving an additional edge over others.

Therefore I am in favour of introducing learning of third language in schools.

**Against:**

Nowadays, academic curriculum of school has become very wide. Contents of each subject has become thick. A student is finding it difficult to study everything. Many educationist are advocating reduction in curriculum.

School authorities put pressure on students to get more marks. The fierce competition beyond the school has put lot of stress on students. Add to it the pressure from parents on the students.

The time available to engage in sports and recreational activity has greatly reduced. Nobody would limit journey of a child between classroom in his school and his study room at home. Let there be an opportunity to look beyond these two compartments.

In this back drop, compulsion to learn one more language would be an additional burden on students. I do not advocate it.

**3. Have you ever changed your opinion about someone or something that you had earlier liked or disliked? Narrate what led you to change your mind.**

We live on 3rd floor of a multi-storied building. My father works in a town about 175 KM away. He comes home every week end.

Next to our flat lives a young couple of about 35. Early morning they go out together in their car and return late in the evening. They do not mingle with others. The lady never replied to my greetings. Somehow I developed a disliking towards the couple.

One day my mother fell sick. It was around 10 PM. She had high fever. I called many people in the society but none answered my call. Finally I called the couple living next to me.

Immediately they took my mother to hospital. Handled all expenses themselves. They both were in the hospital till my father arrived next morning.

My mother soon got well. My parents and I went to their home to express our gratitude. We understood that they worked as high officials in a reputed bank. Every day they go to a orphan house to help kids learn English. They have devoted all their spare time for this activity.

My thought towards them changed for the better.
