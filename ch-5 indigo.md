## üìë Indigo Summary

This story describes Gandhi‚Äôs struggle for the poor peasants of Champaran. In those days most of arable land in the Champaran district was divided into large estate owned by Englishmen and worked by Indian tenants. The chief commercial crop was Indigo. The landlords compelled all tenants to plant 15% of their Indigo and surrender the entire Indigo harvest as rent. This was done by long term contract.

The British didn‚Äôt need the Indigo crop any more when Germany had developed synthetic Indigo. Just to release the peasants from the 15% agreement they demanded compensation. Some illiterate peasants agreed but the others refused. One of the sharecroppers named Raj Kumar Shukla met Gandhi in this regard and compelled him to visit Champaran because of the long term injustice of landlords. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. From there Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad. Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs humble and simple attire made the servants mistook him as another poor peasant. He surveyed before taking any vital step in order to get those peasants justice. It was the time when British government punished those who in any condition gave shelter to national leaders or protesters.

Gandhi‚Äôs arrival and the nature of his mission spread like a wildfire. Many lawyers and peasant groups came in large numbers to support him. The lawyers accepted the fact that their charges were high and for a poor peasant it will be irksome. Gandhi rebuked them for collecting big fee from the sharecroppers. He stressed on counseling as this would give the peasants enough confidence to fight their fear. He managed to get justice after a yearlong battle for the peasants. He also made arrangements for the education, health, and hygiene for the families of the poor peasants. He gave them the lesson of self-reliance.

### üî¥ Understanding the text

**Q1. Why do you think Gandhi considered the Champaran episode to be a turning point in his life?**

A. It was an attempt to remove problems of poor farmers. Gandhiji got support from lawyers, teachers and thousands of farmers. Gandhiji had said that he had done very simple thing. He proved that he could not be ordered by British in his own country. All these laid foundation to his future struggle for freedom of India. Therefore Champaran episode was the turning-point of his life.

**Q2. How was Gandhi able to influence lawyers? Give instances.**

A. Gandhiji scolded lawyers for charging fees from poor farmers. Gandhiji was ready to go to prison for the cause of local farmers. This motivated lawyers to give full support to Gandhiji. By refusing to accept support of Andrews, Gandhiji taught a lesson of self- reliance.

They are always scolded and given unequal treatment in society. The basic human and constitutional rights are denied to them. Their life is an endless misery Poor are becoming poorer. Situation of small farmers is also bad. They continue to live in fear of money lenders and powerful people.

- Gandhi recounted. ‚ÄúA peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, ‚ÄòI am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district!‚Äù
- Gandhi said, ‚ÄúI have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there‚Äù.
- ‚ÄúIt was an extraordinary thing ‚Äòin those days,‚Äù Gandhi commented, Tor a government professor to harbour a man like me.‚Äô
- He said, ‚ÄúI have come to the conclusion that we should stop going to law courts. Taking such cases to the courts does little good. Where the peasants are so crushed and fear-stricken, law courts are useless. The real relief for them is to be free from fear.‚Äù
- ‚ÄúThe commissioner,‚Äù Gandhi reports, ‚Äúproceeded to bully me and advised me forthwith to leave Tirhut‚Äù.
- ‚ÄòBut how much must we pay?‚Äô they asked Gandhi.

- He said, ‚ÄúYou think that in this unequal fight it would be helpful if we have an Englishman on our side. This shows the weakness of your heart.

**Q2. Notice the use or non-use of the comma in the following sentences: (a) When I first visited Gandhi in 1942 at his ashram in Sevagram, he told me what happened in Champaran. (b) He had not proceeded far when the police superintendent‚Äôs messenger overtook him. (c) When the court reconvened, the judge said he would not deliver the judgement for several days.**

A. When the subordinate clause comes before the main clause, a comma is used to separate it from the main clause. No comma is used when the main clause comes before the subordinate clause.
