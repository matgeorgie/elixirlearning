## 📑 Indigo Summary

This story describes Gandhi’s struggle for the poor peasants of Champaran. In those days most of arable land in the Champaran district was divided into large estate owned by Englishmen and worked by Indian tenants. The chief commercial crop was Indigo. The landlords compelled all tenants to plant 15% of their Indigo and surrender the entire Indigo harvest as rent. This was done by long term contract.

The British didn’t need the Indigo crop any more when Germany had developed synthetic Indigo. Just to release the peasants from the 15% agreement they demanded compensation. Some illiterate peasants agreed but the others refused. One of the sharecroppers named Raj Kumar Shukla met Gandhi in this regard and compelled him to visit Champaran because of the long term injustice of landlords. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. From there Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad. Mahatma Gandhi’s humble and simple attire made the servants mistook him as another poor peasant. He surveyed before taking any vital step in order to get those peasants justice. It was the time when British government punished those who in any condition gave shelter to national leaders or protesters.

Gandhi’s arrival and the nature of his mission spread like a wildfire. Many lawyers and peasant groups came in large numbers to support him. The lawyers accepted the fact that their charges were high and for a poor peasant it will be irksome. Gandhi rebuked them for collecting big fee from the sharecroppers. He stressed on counseling as this would give the peasants enough confidence to fight their fear. He managed to get justice after a yearlong battle for the peasants. He also made arrangements for the education, health, and hygiene for the families of the poor peasants. He gave them the lesson of self-reliance.

### 🟠 Thinking about language

**Q1. Notice the sentences in the text which are in ‘direct speech’. Why does the author use quotations in his narration?**

A. The following sentences in the text are in ‘direct speech’.
- He said, “I will tell you how it happened that I decided to urge the departure of the British. It was in 1917.”
- Gandhi recounted. “A peasant came up to me looking like any other peasant in India, poor and emaciated, and said, ‘I am Rajkumar Shukla. I am from Champaran, and I want you to come to my district!”
- Gandhi said, “I have to be in Calcutta on such-and-such a date. Come and meet me and take me from there”.
- “It was an extraordinary thing ‘in those days,” Gandhi commented, Tor a government professor to harbour a man like me.’
- He said, “I have come to the conclusion that we should stop going to law courts. Taking such cases to the courts does little good. Where the peasants are so crushed and fear-stricken, law courts are useless. The real relief for them is to be free from fear.”
- “The commissioner,” Gandhi reports, “proceeded to bully me and advised me forthwith to leave Tirhut”.
- ‘But how much must we pay?’ they asked Gandhi.
- One woman took Kasturbabai into her hut and said, “Look, there is no box or cupboard here for clothes The sari I am wearing is the only one I have”.
- “What I did”, he explained, “was a very ordinary thing. I declared that the British could not order me about in my own country”.
- He said, “You think that in this unequal fight it would be helpful if we have an Englishman on our side. This shows the weakness of your heart. The cause is just and you must rely upon yourselves to win the battle. You should not seek a prop in Mr ‘ Andrews because he happens to be an Englishman”.
- “He had read our minds correctly,” Rajendra Prasad comments, “and we had no reply … Gandhi in this way taught uS a lesson in self-reliance”.

(b) He had not proceeded far when the police superintendent’s messenger overtook him. (c) When the court reconvened, the judge said he would not deliver the judgement for several days.**

A. When the subordinate clause comes before the main clause, a comma is used to separate it from the main clause. No comma is used when the main clause comes before the subordinate clause.
