## üìë Going Places Summary

This story describes Gandhi‚Äôs struggle for the poor peasants of Champaran. In those days most of arable land in the Champaran district was divided into large estate owned by Englishmen and worked by Indian tenants. The chief commercial crop was Indigo. The landlords compelled all tenants to plant 15% of their Indigo and surrender the entire Indigo harvest as rent. This was done by long term contract.

The British didn‚Äôt need the Indigo crop any more when Germany had developed synthetic Indigo. Just to release the peasants from the 15% agreement they demanded compensation. Some illiterate peasants agreed but the others refused. One of the sharecroppers named Raj Kumar Shukla met Gandhi in this regard and compelled him to visit Champaran because of the long term injustice of landlords. Then the two of them boarded a train for the city of Patna in Bihar. From there Shukla led him to the house of a lawyer named Rajendra Prasad. Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs humble and simple attire made the servants mistook him as another poor peasant. He surveyed before taking any vital step in order to get those peasants justice. It was the time when British government punished those who in any condition gave shelter to national leaders or protesters.

Gandhi‚Äôs arrival and the nature of his mission spread like a wildfire. Many lawyers and peasant groups came in large numbers to support him. The lawyers accepted the fact that their charges were high and for a poor peasant it will be irksome. Gandhi rebuked them for collecting big fee from the sharecroppers. He stressed on counseling as this would give the peasants enough confidence to fight their fear. He managed to get justice after a yearlong battle for the peasants. He also made arrangements for the education, health, and hygiene for the families of the poor peasants. He gave them the lesson of self-reliance.

**Q2. It is natural for teenagers to have unrealistic dreams. What would you say are the benefits and disadvantages of such fantasising?**

A. Mind at the teenage is very sensitive. Teenagers always dream of improving their current situation. It is such a natural phenomenon. It is said that only those who dream big can grow and achieve. Every achievement needs to be first visualized. Those who do not visulise growth fail to realise their potential. What separates a dream and its achievement is an obvious question. Those who work towards achieving their dreams always become successful. It is the sustained hard work and dedication or its absence that makes the difference. A good planning, excellent execution and development of resources is a sure path to success. Lack of planning and inability to garner required resources can kill dreams. Every person dreams but not all are prepared to go through the tough path of success. Non realization of dreams can sometimes cause depression and frustration among individuals. Hence they should moderate their dreams in proportion to the hard work and planning they are ready to put in.
