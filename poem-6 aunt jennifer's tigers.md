## 📑 Aunt Jennifer's Tigers Summary

In the poem ‘Aunt Jennifer’s Tigers’ a woman expresses her suppressed feelings through her art. Aunt Jennifer is the victim of the male dominated society. She has no one to tell her mental and physical pain. She makes a picture to convey her deep feelings. The speaker describes the tigers which her aunt produced on the panel. They are set in motion. They are moving quickly by raising the front legs and jumping forwards on the back legs. In the green jungle they look free, bright, brave, fearless and magnificent. There are men sitting under the tree, but the tigers do not. They move on to their goal boldly and smoothly. Jennifer finds it difficult to make pictures by using the ivory needle. She is tired of doing the household work after she got married. She can’t get herself involved in her artistic work. She has to do it in her leisure time. Even then she has to be sure whether her husband is watching her or not. So her hands are terrified. She will not be free from fear until she dies. She will be dominated by her husband. She will die, but her art will express her desire to move proudly and fearlessly like the tigers she has made.

## 🔍 Aunt Jennifer's Tigers Question and Answer

### 🟢 Think it out

**Q1.  How do ‘denizens’ and ‘chivalric’ add to our understanding of the tiger’s attitudes?**

A. The word ‘denizens’ means that they are proud of their home, they feel safe there and have a feeling of belonging attached to it. The word ‘chivalric’ shows that they have a majestic and worthy position like knights.

**Q2. Why do you think Aunt Jennifer’s hands are ‘fluttering through her wool’ in the second stanza? Why is she finding the needle so hard to pull?** 

A. Her hands are fluttering probably because she is scared of her husband who could come anytime and scold her for sitting idle and wasting her time doing embroidery. She finds the needle so hard to pull because her fingers are tired of working endlessly all through her life.

**Q3. What is suggested by the image ‘massive weight of Uncle’s wedding band’?**

A. ‘Massive weight of Uncle’s wedding band’ suggest symbolically, that the bindings and obligations of her marriage are so much that they have put a lot of burden and stress on her.

**Q4. Of what or of whom is Aunt Jennifer terrified with in the third stanza?**

A. Even after death, Aunt would carry her fear of her domineering husband as she would yet bear the burden of the wedding band on her finger. The ordeals faced by her in an oppressive marriage would continue to terrify her.

**Q5. What are the ‘ordeals’ Aunt Jennifer is surrounded by, why is it significant that the poet uses the word ‘ringed’? What are the meanings of the word ‘ringed’ in the poem?**

A. The ‘ordeals’ are

- Obeying her husband’s orders.
- Fear of men.
- Giving in to his dominance and fulfilling his commands.  

‘Ringed’ indicates entrapment. As the ring encircles the finger, similarly, her husband has encircled her in his clutches. Her body and soul are both trapped, struggling for freedom and fearlessness.

**Q6. Why do you think Aunt Jennifer created animals that are so different from her own character? What might the poet be suggesting, through this difference?**

A. I think that aunt Jennifer’s intense desire for freedom and fearlessness came out through her creativity. This is the time when she is with herself, and then, her innermost feelings are expressed, here her medium of expression is the embroidery. Through this difference, it is shown that the lady is not what she is. Her circumstances have made her so but even she has a desire to live life with respect and pride.

**Q7. Interpret the symbols found in this poem.**

A. The symbols found in this poem are: 

- **Wedding band**: symbol of oppression in an unhappy marriage. Marriage is socially and legally binding, making women silently accept their subjugation and male domination, especially in a patriarchal society. Its weight refers to the burden of gender expectations. Ringed means encircled or trapped, losing individuality and freedom.
- **Aunt Jennifer**: a typical victim of male oppression in an unhappy marriage, who suffers loss of individuality, dignity and personal freedom silently. She becomes dependent, fearful and frail.
- **Tigers**: symbolize untamed free spirit. Here they are antithesis of their creator’s personality. The use of colours implies that Aunt Jennifer's tigers and their land are more vital and enjoy a sense of freedom far greater than her. Yellow (bright topaz) connotes the sun and fierce energy, while green reminds one of spring and vitality. They pace and prance freely, proudly, fearless, confident and majestic in their bearing.
- **Embroidery**: symbol of creative expression. The artwork expresses the Aunt’s suppressed desires and becomes her escape from the oppressive reality of her life.
- **Aunt** (last stanza): as opposed to Aunt Jennifer. It shows that she has lost her identity completely, thus lost even her name.

**Q8. Do you sympathize with Aunt Jennifer. What is the attitude of the speaker towards Aunt Jennifer?**

A. Yes, the character of Aunt Jennifer wins our sympathy as a reader. Her ordeals and sufferings move the reader. Even the speaker in the poem shows sympathy and pity towards her. The speaker says that even after Aunt Jennifer's death, she will be terrified of her husband and the ordeals of her marriage.
