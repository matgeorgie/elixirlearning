## üìë Lost Spring Summary

The author tells us stories of her interactions with children from deprived backgrounds. She describes their poor condition and life in an interesting manner. The story touches the reader and is thought-provoking.

The author described two of her encounters with children from deprived backgrounds. Through them she wants to highlight the plight of street children forced into labour early in life and are denied the opportunity of schooling. Also, she brings out the callousness of society and the political class towards the sufferings of the poor. The first encounter is with a rag picker boy named Saheb ‚Äì E ‚Äì Alam who migrated from Bangladesh in 1971 and lives in Seemapuri in Delhi. These ragpicker children look for ‚Äòvaluables‚Äô in the garbage ‚Äì things like a coin or torn shoes which are as precious as ‚Äògold‚Äô for them.

They could hardly manage some food for themselves, other things like identity, education, shoes and sports are their unfulfilled dreams. Their parents scrounged the garbage searching for things that helped them survive ‚Äì afford food, clothing and shelter for the family. The children hunted through the garbage heaps looking for things which could partially fulfil their unfulfilled dreams.

One day the writer saw the boy, holding a steel can, going towards the milk booth. He had got a job at a tea stall. He was happy that he would get eight hundred rupees and all the meals. The writer noticed that Saheb had lost the freedom of being his own master which he had enjoyed as a rag picker.

The second boy was Mukesh who belonged to a family of bangle makers in Firozabad. The boy had a dream of becoming a car mechanic. On the contrary, his family was traditionally engaged in bangle making, although the profession harmed them physically and they hardly earned any money out of it.

Still, no one dared to dream of doing something else due to the fear of the police and the middlemen. The family elders were content that other than teaching the art of bangle‚Äìmaking to their children, they had been able to build them a house to live in. The boy wanted to be a car mechanic. Cars were all that Mukesh had seen on the roads of his town and so, he could not dream any further.

**Q2. Would you agree that promises made to poor children are rarely kept? Why do you think this happens in the incidents narrated in the text?**

A. Yes, I agree that the promises made to poor children are rarely fulfilled. In the story the writer jokingly offers the rag picker boy to join a school that she would open. In fact, she does not intend to open a school. She speaks mindlessly but the boy takes it to be true and later asks her if the school has opened. There are many such hollow promises in the boy‚Äôs life because the person who makes the promise never intends to fulfil it.

The money ‚Äì lenders, middlemen, policemen, law ‚Äì keepers, officers and politicians altogether form a barrier around them and tie them in the grip of poverty. They cannot escape from it.


### üîµ Talking about the text

**Q1. How, in your opinion, can Mukesh realise his dream?**

A. Mukesh dared to dream and wanted to become a motor mechanic. He wanted to drive cars too. He took the initial step by aspiring to do something different from the family business. I think that Mukesh can realize his dream with determination and hard work.

**Q2. Mention the hazards of working in the glass bangles industry.**

A. The poor bangle makers in Firozabad work in dangerous conditions. The furnaces have very high temperatures and no ventilation. Hence, they are prone to ailments like lung cancer. While polishing the bangles, the dust harms their eyes and many lose their vision. They remain in dark for long hours and so are unable to see during the daytime.

**Q3. Why should child labour be eliminated and how?**

A. Forcing a child to work is a crime. This is so in order to prevent exploitation of children. If forced to work, Children cannot enjoy their childhood. They cannot get proper education. Also, when they are forced into hazardous works, they get ailments at a young age. This destroys their future. Their parents overlook all these facts as they need money. So, the government has to become proactive and take measures to check child labour and enforce the law strictly.

### üü° Thinking about the language

**Although this text speaks of factual events and situations of misery it transforms these situations with an almost poetical prose into a literary experience. How does it do so? Here are some literary devices:**

- *Hyperbole* is a way of speaking or writing that makes something sound better or more exciting than it really is. For example: Garbage to them is gold.
- A *Metaphor*, as you may know, compares two things or ideas that are not very similar. A metaphor describes a thing in terms of a single quality or feature of some other thing; we can say that a metaphor ‚Äútransfers‚Äù a quality of one thing to another. For example: The road was a ribbon of light.
- *Simile* is a word or phrase that compares one thing with another using the words ‚Äúlike‚Äù or ‚Äúas‚Äù. For example: As white as snow.

**Carefully read the following phrases and sentences taken from the text. Can you identify the literary device in each example?**

1. Saheb-e-Alam which means the lord of the universe is directly in contrast to what Saheb is in reality: **Hyperbole**
2. Drowned in an air of desolation: **Metaphor**
3. Seemapuri, a place on the periphery of Delhi yet miles away from it, metaphorically: **Metaphor**
4. For the children it is wrapped in wonder; for the elders it is a means of survival: **Metaphor**
5. As her hands move mechanically like the tongs of a machine, I wonder if she knows the sanctity of the bangles she helps make: **Simile**
6. She still has bangles on her wrist, but not light in her eyes: **Metaphor**
7. Few airplanes fly over Firozabad: **Metaphor**
8. Web of poverty: **Metaphor**
9. Scrounging for gold: **Metaphor**
10. And survival in Seemapuri means rag-picking. Through the years, it has acquired the proportions of a fine art: **Hyperbole**
11. The steel canister seems heavier than the plastic bag he would carry so lightly over his shoulders: **Metphor**
