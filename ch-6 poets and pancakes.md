## üìë Poets and Pancakes Summary

Pancakes were used as make-up material in the studio by many famous actresses and the studio buys in a very good amount. He humorously told us that these pancakes turned decent-looking characters into monsters. The cameras and studio lights require that the artist should look ugly. And in turn, all players were made to look ugly. 

The department had an office boy also who was around 40 years old and believed he had so much talent. He wishes to become a star actor, director, screenwriter, or lyrics writer. The make-up department was upstairs and looked like a saloon, so anyone who comes there in the scorching heat and light to get themselves ready feels they were in Hell. 

The department also stood for national integrity as in its initial days it was headed by a Bengali, then by a Maharashtrian, assisted by many people all around the world. The author‚Äôs job was looked down upon by everyone in the department as he was always seen tearing newspapers. Everyone comes to please him and even the office boy comes to recite his poems but all goes in vain in front of Subbu.

The office boy got vexed by this and certainly, he had green eyes towards Subbu. Subbu was very close to the boss and whenever he faced any difficulty in presenting the scene, Subbu was there with prompt ideas to present.  He was good at writing poems and could write in high order but suppressed his talent and wrote in simple Tamil. 

He has written novels also in which he recreated the mood of Devadasis to make them life-like always.  He was also an excellent actor and sometimes performed better than the lead actor. But he played subordinate roles only.  He loved all of his relatives who come and live with him and never give a shit to money.

Subbu was a member of the story department in the studio but always seen with the boss. Besides, there was a legal advisor also in the studio who was known for his cold behavior and illogical facts. Once he also destroyed the career of a talented actress.

One day an actress showed tantrums on the sets and spoke against the producer. The legal advisor cunningly recorded her voice and played in between the shooting, she was shocked to hear her own voice and never returned on the sets. 

The Gemini Studio hosted the two most influential plays and they became a huge success and later on, he came to know that MRA was the counter-communist movement. The writer also informed about the visit of an English poet Stephen Spender for an unknown reason grand preparations were done for him.  They all were confused about his purpose of visit and could not understand what he spoke about.

Asokamitran‚Äôs duty was not considered important by all and he was engaged in paper cutting and making files. Everybody wanted to give some tasks to him and he also remains at beck and call. The author soon looked at a notice in the Hindu. A story which has been organized by a British Periodical called The Encounter. He came to know that the editor of that journal was none other than Stephen Spender. 

After that, he came to know about a book titled, The God That Failed. It contained six essays about the failed communism and out of them one was written by Stephen Spender. The mystery was solved and the purpose too.
