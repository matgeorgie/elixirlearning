## üìë The Rattrap Summary

The Rattrap is a story about a rattrap seller who leads a very poor life as his earnings are very low. He has to resort to thievery and begging to make both ends meet. He is alone in this whole world and leads a miserable life. So he starts knitting up various kinds of thoughts. One of these thoughts is of supposing the whole world as a big rattrap. His views are that the world offers us various types of baits in the form of comforts of life. This in return traps us into the rattrap of the world and leads us to various types of miseries.

Every night, the peddler had to search for shelter as he has no home. One evening he was offered shelter by an old crofter. The next morning he stole the crofter‚Äôs money which he had earned by selling his cow‚Äôs milk. To safeguard himself, the peddler chose the path through the forest which was secluded, but soon found himself trapped in the forest as he wasn‚Äôt able to find the way out of the dense forest. Later on, he finds a way to a forge and takes shelter there. Something unusual happens. The ironmaster mistakes him as an old friend and invites him to his house. The poor peddler rejects the offer due to the fear of being caught. Soon he is invited by the ironmaster‚Äòs daughter. The next morning he is somehow stopped by the ironmaster‚Äôs daughter for Christmas Eve even after being caught that he was a peddler and not Captain Stalhe.

The next day after Christmas, when the ironmaster and his daughter visit the church, they come to know that the man is a thief who had stolen money from the old crofter. The iron master and his daughter repent for sheltering a thief and wonder at what all things he would have stolen by that time. Here comes a twist as instead of stealing, the peddler gifts the ironmaster‚Äôs daughter a rattrap. She finds a letter of thanks and the stolen money inside the rattrap. The peddler thanks Edla for her kindness and requests her to return the stolen money to the crofter. This story gives us the message that goodness in a human being can be awakened at any time with your own good deeds.

### üî¥ Understanding the text

**Q1. How does the peddler interpret the acts of kindness and hospitality shown by the crofter, the ironmaster and his daughter?**

A. The peddler was a rattrap seller. He was leading a life of misery. He was homeless. Moreover, he didn‚Äôt have enough money to survive. So, he had to depend upon begging and thievery. He was once offered shelter by an old crofter. He wanted company and showed kindness towards the peddler by sharing his porridge and tobacco. In return, the peddler betrayed him and stole his money.

The ironmaster mistook him as his old companion Captain Von Stahle; he showed his kindness to him and invited him to his house for Christmas Eve. The peddler knew that the ironmaster was making a mistake by thinking him to be his old friend but here also he did not clear the air and simply accepted the invitation. He did this so that the ironmaster may give him some money out of pity.

Elda Williamson who was the iron master‚Äôs daughter invited him to their house in a very friendly way. Also, she insisted her father to let him stay for Christmas Eve even after it was revealed that he was not Captain Von Stahle. The kind nature of Elda changed the peddler and he not only thanked her by gifting a rattrap for being so kind and caring but also requested her to return the stolen money to the old crofter.

**Q2. What are the instances in the story that show that the character of the ironmaster is different from that of his daughter in many ways?**

A. The character of both ironmaster and his daughter were totally different from each other.
The iron master was a proud man. When he saw the peddler, he mistook him as an old regimental comrade and tried to help him out of his sense of pride. When he realized that he had been mistaken, he called the peddler to be dishonest and also warned him of calling the sheriff. Not only this, he worried about his silver spoons when he comes to know that peddler was a thief. On the other hand, the ironmaster‚Äôs daughter was a kind lady, who really wanted to help the peddler. She treated him with respect and it was her kind nature that changed the peddler and made him a good person.

**Q3. The story has many instances of unexpected reactions from the characters to others‚Äô behaviour. Pick out instances of these surprises?**

A. The story has many instances of unexpected reactions from the characters to others‚Äô behavior. For example:
One evening when the peddler knocked at the door of a little hut, he was not disappointed by the owner rather he welcomed him and tried to be a good host to him by offering him food and playing cards with him. In another instance when the peddler went inside a forge to seek shelter, there he was invited by the ironmaster to his house as he mistook him as one of his old regimental comrade. But when the ironmaster realized that he had invited some unknown person to his house, he asked him to leave. At his time, he was allowed to stay by his daughter Elda out of kindness.

**Q4. What made the peddler finally change his ways?**

A. Edla Willimansson‚Äôs kindness reformed the peddler. Her kindness, compassion, and generosity killed the thief in him. He gifted her a rattrap. Also, he returned the three ten kronor notes that he had stolen from the crofter‚Äôs house. He requested her to return the money to the old crofter. He wrote a letter to her, thanking her for treating him well just like she would have treated a real captain.

**Q5. How does the metaphor of the rattrap serve to highlight the human predicament?**

A. The world tempts human beings with various good things such as luxuries and joys, food and shelter, clothing and warmth, etc. They are just like the bait which is planted to trap someone in the rattrap of the world. In the story, the peddler was attracted to the three ten kronors of the crofter, which he stole from him. Later on, he found himself trapped in the forest as he planned to hide by walking through the woods. When he got trapped, he thought that this was a punishment for his sin of getting lured by the money.

**Q6. The peddler comes out as a person with a subtle sense of humour. How does this serve in lightening the seriousness of the theme of the story and also endear him to us?**

A. We can see the peddler‚Äôs sense of humour when he compares the world with a rattrap. Whenever he gets caught due to his own knitted stories, he tries to prove his innocence by believing that he has fallen into the trap of this world which actually is like a rattrap. This lightens the seriousness of the story and makes the reader sympathize with him.

### üîµ Talking about the text

**Discuss the following in groups of four. Each group can deal with one topic. Present the views of your group to the whole class.**

**Q1. The reader‚Äôs sympathy is with the peddler right from the beginning of the story. Why is this so? Is the sympathy justified?**

A. The peddler was extremely poor. He used to sell rattraps made out of wire. It was difficult for him to make two ends meet. He was forced to beg and indulge in theft. He did not have home. He used to sleep along the road. Because of his poor living condition the peddler earns sympathy This is during initial part of the story. During middle of the story, an old crofter gave him shelter at his home. He was given good hospitality. The crofter showed confidence in him. He even showed his money to peddler. However when peddler betrays the trust and steals money of the old crofter, he losses sympathy. In the later part of the story, the ironmaster threatens him to hand over to Sheriff. There was no fault of the peddler. Once again sympathy is generated for him. Lastly, he changes for the good and leaves a gift for Edla. He left the stolen money for Edla with a request to return it to the crofter. This act certainly earns lot of sympathy towards peddler. Therefore, except on one occasion, sympathy of the reader is always with the peddler.

**Q2. The story also focuses on human loneliness and the need to bond with others.**

A. The peddler was all alone in the world. He did not know anybody with whom he could interact. He had been moving from one place to another. He had become used to seeing sour faces of people. It is very clear that the crofter was living alone. He was so eager to talk to a person in his loneliness that he extended excellent hospitality to his guest. The ironmaster was living without his wife and his sons. One is inclined to conclude that he was not lonely because his daughter was living with hen But his eagerness to extend hospitality to his old comrade indicates that he was feeling lonely to some extent. Edla appears to be not having any company at all. Her thought process was very much different from that of her father. It is doubtful if she talked much with her father. Thus she was certainly lonely in her house. Thus throughout the story, loneliness of various characters has been brought about.

**Q3. Have you known/heard of an episode where a good deed or an act of kindness has changed a person‚Äôs view of the world?**

A. Yes, I know how the kindness of a Bishop transformed a hard-hearted beastly convict into a man again with faith in God and human values. The story is presented in the form of a famous play ‚ÄòThe Bishop‚Äôs Candlesticks‚Äô The Bishop provides food and shelter at midnight to a runaway convict who threatens him with a knife. Long years of imprisonment and harsh treatment in the prisonship has transformed the man into beast and he is devoid of all human feelings now. The convict runs away with the Bishop‚Äôs silver candlesticks, but is caught by the police.   In order to save the convict from further punishment and torture, the Bishop tells the police officer that the fellow is his friend and he had himself given him the candlesticks. This kind act of the Bishop melts the hard heart of the convict. He sobs and weeps. He promises to be a man again.


**Q4. The story is both entertaining and philosophical.**

A. The story has been narrated quite nicely. There are interesting situations in the story. The dialogues are precise and invite attention of the reader. The full story has been increadinly woven together. Some elements of surprises have been built into the story. Moreover the story ends on a happy note. All these make the story quite interesting. The aspect of rattrap has been philosophically connected to the pursuit of worldly pleasure. World offers so many temptations or baits, that we may fall into its trap any day. The peddler's attempt to curse the ironmaster brings another philosophical attitude. The kindness and hospitality by Edla on the Christmas Eve highlights yet another part of philosophy. And finally, the impact of kindness to change a person is clearly magnified. Thus the story is entertaining as well as philosophical.
